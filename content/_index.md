In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, the GENIUS project emerges as a collaborative initiative addressing challenges posed by manual-intensive processes and the untapped potential of Generative AI.
In the GENIUS project, we aim to develop automated solutions and customized tools to enhance the different phases of the development life cycle, leveraging the advanced capabilities of Generative AI and Large Language Models.
These innovative methods and tools will support software engineers with generated software artifacts such as requirements, code, and test cases, comprehensible documentation and guidelines tailored to company-specific data, offer software quality analysis and improvements, and provide recommendations with professional chat functionalities.
