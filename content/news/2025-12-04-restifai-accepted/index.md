It's time for a samba class!
Our Paper "RESTifAI: LLM-Based Workflow for Reusable REST API Testing" has been accepted for the ICSE 2026 Demonstration Track.
Incredibly proud of the team Leon Kogler, Benedikt Dornauer (Universität Innsbruck), Martin Hairer and the entire development team at CASABLANCA hotelsoftware GmbH.
A special thanks to our coauthor Eduard Enoiu, to Peter Schrammel for giving us valueable feedback and to GENIUS.
Looking forward to present the work in Rio.
If you’d like to learn more, we’ve put together a [short blog post](https://research.casablanca.at/post/restifai-a-prototype-for-smarter-api-testing) with additional details.
